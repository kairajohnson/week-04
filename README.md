## OOJS

### Question #1

What are constructor functions and the `new` keyword? What is a prototype? Describe an example of when we would use a constructor function versus a prototype.

Your Answer:
```text
A construction function is like a standard function but it has objects we can use like an object literal. When a constructor function is made, you must use the 'new' keyword to initiate the function. When you type the constructor name and new, it creates a new object. a Prototype allows you to add new properties or methods to the existing constructor function.  
```

### Question #2

Define a Javascript constructor called 'Instructor'. Every instance of Instructor should have a `name` property, and a method called `givesHomework`. This method takes one argument called `assignment` and, when executed, console-logs "[name] gives the students [assignment] for Friday's homework."

Instantiate an instructor named 'Robin' and call its `givesHomework` method with "Intro to Ruby" as the argument.

Your Answer:

```js

function Instructor () {
  name = name;
  givesHomework = function (assignment) {
    console.log("[name] gives the students [assignment] for Fridays homework.");
  }
  var Robin = new Instructor (givesHomework("Intro to Ruby"))
}

```
### Question #3

Given the following front-end JS model, add an instance method for all pandas called `eat_bamboo`. Calling this method should increase that panda's value for `num_bamboo_eaten` by 1.

```js

var Panda = function(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.num_bamboo_eaten = 0;
}
```
Your Answer:
```js
// your code here
```

### Question #4

Describe the importance of using object-oriented programming.

Your Answer:
```
It is important to use OOP becaue it allows our code to be DRY and we can target our object more affectively by creating various functions that target that one object.
```

## jQuery

### Question #5

Which of the following statements will work, assuming jQuery is loaded?

Select all that apply:
```
[x] `$(".post").css("background", "peachpuff")`
[] `$(".post").innerHTML`
[x] `$(".post").html()`
[] `document.querySelectorAll(".post")[0].innerHTML`
[] `document.querySelectorAll(".post").innerHTML`
```

### Question #6

Using jQuery, add an event listener for clicks on the button with the id
`greeting`. When the event happens, the code should append a paragraph to the
body that says "hello".

Your Answer:
```js

$("#greeting").click($("body").append("<p> + 'hello' + </p>"));
```

### Question #7

Define a function called `doSomething`. It should take one argument, called
`thingToDo`. When called, `doSomething` should invoke the `thingToDo` function. Demonstrate calling `doSomething` while passing in an argument.

Your Answer:
```js
function doSomething (thingToDo) {
  $("#Test")thingsToDo.click(doSomething);

}
```

### Question #8

Once in Vanilla JS, and once in jQuery, write a function that adds an event listener for when a button with a class of "submit-quiz" is clicked. The event alerts a user "Great Job on Quiz 4!".

Your Answer:
```js
$(".submit-quiz").click(function (){
  alert("Great Job on Quiz 4!");
})

```
